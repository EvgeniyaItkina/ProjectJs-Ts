# My FullStack Journey

Welcome to my evolving project portfolio following a 5-month intensive block of a FullStack web development course. Starting from scratch, I've acquired foundational skills in programming languages and web development technologies.

## Technologies Used

Throughout this journey, I've utilized a range of technologies to build various web applications, including:

-   HTML: The essential building block of web content.
-   CSS: For styling and enhancing layout.
-   SASS: Extensively used in the "Gallery" project for efficient CSS development.
-   Bootstrap: Applied in the "Map" project and partially on the main page for responsive design.
-   JavaScript: Encompassing API requests, DOM manipulation, callback functions, and local storage. Also explored the canvas for dynamic web elements.
-   TypeScript: Leveraged for adding static type definitions to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
-   OOP Concepts: Applied Object-Oriented Programming principles across projects to structure code more efficiently and logically.

## Projects Overview

### Main Page

The main page serves as a showcase for all projects, highlighting my ability to translate design layouts into functional web applications. It demonstrates selective Bootstrap application for enhanced user experience.

### Project Coffee

Despite being the simplest of the assigned projects, Project Coffee played a crucial role in my learning journey. With guidance from my mentor, I not only initiated the project but also independently refined it to align perfectly with the provided design layout. Additionally, I worked extensively to ensure its responsiveness.

### Project Gallery

Project Gallery showcases my proficiency in SASS, a powerful CSS preprocessor. I've used SASS to streamline the styling process and create a visually appealing gallery. It demonstrates my ability to work with advanced CSS techniques.

In addition to that, I took the design to the next level by adding styles to the images and frames that give the impression of real paintings.

### Project Map

In Project Map, I integrated the Bootstrap library to enhance the user interface and provide a smooth user experience. Bootstrap's components and responsive design capabilities were instrumental in creating a functional map application.

### Project HereNow

Project HereNow showcases my versatility in web development. I've added different styles for various breakpoints in the mobile version, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Additional Projects

On my website, you'll also find two additional projects: "Project Cat" and "Project Nurse," which were entirely designed and developed by me. These projects showcase my proficiency in web development and encompass various features, including user-triggered animations and keyframes-driven automatic animations.

### Project "Model"

In modern web development, there are many scenarios where you need to create target pages where users can view larger images by hovering over certain elements. In this project, within a simple and stylish design, I provide a convenient and intuitive solution for adding new images while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.

### Newly Added Projects

-   **Project Screen Builder**: A modular design approach with enhanced HTML knowledge. Uses local storage for data management.
-   **Project Clock**: Implements API for real-time information on capital cities and flags, with timezone adjustments.
-   **Project Simon**: Employs asynchronous technology with a unique outcome display upon game loss.
-   **Project Task Manager**: Combines DOM manipulation, local storage, and OOP principles for task management.
-   **Project Calculator**: Utilizes callback functions and switch cases for a functional calculator interface.
-   **Project Snake**: A complex, self-taught project using the canvas, with consideration for mobile responsiveness.
-   **Project Marry Me**: A playful and engaging web application designed to capture a memorable moment with a simple yet impactful interaction. Developed using TypeScript, this project introduces dynamic behaviors and audio responses to user choices, enhancing the interactive experience. Dynamic Interaction: Features an evasive "No" button, creating a humorous challenge that encourages a positive response. Audio Integration: Two distinct audio tracks play based on the user's decision, adding depth to the interaction. TypeScript: Utilizes TypeScript for improved code reliability and maintainability.

This project combines technical proficiency with creative design to offer a unique user experience.

## Achievements

Developed and refined web applications from scratch.
Applied responsive design principles across projects for an optimal user experience.
Enhanced layout and styling using Bootstrap and SASS.
Addressed complex web development scenarios using JavaScript, and the canvas.

### Conclusion

This portfolio not only showcases my technical skills but also my dedication to learning and improving as a FullStack developer. I look forward to tackling more challenging projects and continuing my journey in web development.

Thank you for exploring my projects!
